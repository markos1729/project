Pseudocode:

1. filter query relations & get passing rowids for each one (just an array for each one)
2. for each join binding (x.y=q.z) (order may have been changed by optimizer = next step)
        extract correct joinRelations from intermediate if not empty & from initial rowids
        Result=RadixHashJoin(Jbinding0,Jbinding1)
        update intermediate relation list with Result
            -if only one of the two is already in intermediate
                for each tuple in intermediate: append ???
                  
3. get checksums from intermediate relation ids
